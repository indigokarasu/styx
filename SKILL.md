# Styx — Transaction Data Store

Styx is the system's transaction intelligence layer. It sits between raw bank
data (from Plaid via financial-sync) and consumer skills that need clean
merchant information (Taste, Rally, Vesper, Sands).

## When to Use

- Enriching garbled/obfuscated transaction names into real business entities
- Merchant lookup and business matching from transaction data
- Answering "what did I spend" or "where did I spend" questions
- Pulling/syncing bank transactions via Plaid API
- Spending analysis, pattern detection, or calendar-based spending context
- Providing clean merchant data to consumer skills (Taste, Rally, Vesper, Sands)
- Parsing email receipts (e.g., Rainbow Grocery eReceipts) and storing line items in `receipt_line_items` table

## When NOT to Use

- Budgeting strategy or financial planning (use Rally)
- Email-based consumption scanning (use Taste)
- Creating or modifying transactions (use your bank directly)
- General web research or non-transaction search (use Sift)
- Account management (adding/removing bank links) — use Plaid Link flow directly

## Workflow

Styx operates a continuous ingest-enrich-serve workflow because raw transaction data requires normalization before it becomes useful to downstream skills.

- [ ] **Ingest** — Pull transactions from Plaid API (daily cron or on-demand)
- [ ] **Enrich** — Resolve garbled merchant names via SearXNG search + LLM resolution
- [ ] **Store** — Write enriched records to SQLite database
- [ ] **Serve** — Expose query API for consumer skills (Taste, Rally, Vesper, Sands)

Example: a transaction from "UNK MERCHANT 1234" is enriched via SearXNG search → identified as "Whole Foods Market" → stored with clean merchant name → Taste queries for spending patterns.

## Core principles

1. **Raw data is sacred** — transaction records from Plaid are never modified.
   Enrichment data lives in separate tables, linked by transaction_id.
2. **Append-only** — Styx only adds new records. It never deletes or updates
   raw transactions. Enrichment records can be superseded (marked stale) but
   not deleted.
3. **Read-only for consumers** — other skills query Styx via the query API
   or read the SQLite DB directly. They do NOT write to Styx tables.
4. **Enrichment is idempotent** — running enrichment on already-enriched
   transactions produces the same result. Safe to re-run.

## Data flow

See `references/data-flow.md` for the data flow diagram.

## Database

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Styx maintains its own SQLite database at `<hermes-home>/data/styx.db`.
**IMPORTANT:** Hardcode this path. Do NOT use `{agent_root}` — it resolves to the indigo profile home, not the shared data directory.

The active DBs are:
- `<hermes-home>/data/transactions.db` — raw Plaid transaction data (1,187 transactions, last: 2026-06-24)
- `<hermes-home>/data/styx.db` — enriched merchant data (1,193 transaction_merchants links, 493 merchants)

**Note:** Plaid `/transactions/sync` cursor can get stuck and miss transactions. If `MAX(date)` is stale, use `/transactions/get` backfill pattern (see `references/plaid-sync-cursor-recovery.md`). Sync cursors reset after backfill.

A second copy exists at `<hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-styx/styx.db` but it is a stale 0-byte stub — ignore it.

=======
**DB PATHS MIGRATE — never trust a single hardcoded path.** The skill copy of
this section has repeatedly drifted from reality (it once said `~/.hermes/data/`,
then a migration moved live data to `~/.hermes.old/data/`, and as of
2026-07-22 the live ledger is at `<fs-root>/indigo-repo/data/`). Always locate the
active DB fresh before querying:

```bash
find /root -name 'transactions.db' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' 2>/dev/null
# active copy = most-recent mtime AND non-empty; check with:
for db in $(find /root -name 'transactions.db' 2>/dev/null); do
  printf "%s mtime=%s maxdate=" "$db" "$(stat -c %y "$db"|cut -d. -f1)"
  sqlite3 "$db" "SELECT MAX(date) FROM transactions;" 2>/dev/null
done
```

Two distinct SQLite files:
- `transactions.db` — raw Plaid transaction data (`accounts`, `transactions`,
  `plaid_items`, `sync_cursor`). This is what you query to verify charges.
- `styx.db` — enriched merchant data (`merchants`, `transaction_merchants`,
  `enrichment_runs`, `receipt_line_items`). NO amount/date columns — it holds
  merchant enrichment only, not the transaction ledger. Don't query it looking
  for a $155 charge; it won't be there.

**Verifying a bank/credit alert against local data:** see
`references/verify-bank-alert.md` (recipe: freshness check + exact-amount search
+ card-mask match). A 2026-07-22 Capital One case proved the value: the ledger
was ~2 weeks stale for the alert date AND the alert's card mask didn't match any
linked account — so local data neither confirmed nor denied, and <operator> had to
verify in-app.

**Note:** Plaid `/transactions/sync` cursor can get stuck and miss transactions. If `MAX(date)` is stale, use `/transactions/get` backfill pattern (see `references/plaid-sync-cursor-recovery.md`). Sync cursors reset after backfill.

### Schema

Three core tables: `merchants`, `transaction_merchants`, `enrichment_runs`.
Receipt parsing table: `receipt_line_items` (23 columns — see below).
Full DDL: [`references/schema.md`](references/schema.md)

### receipt_line_items Table (23 columns)

Used for storing parsed email receipt line items (e.g., Rainbow Grocery eReceipts).

See `references/receipt-line-items-insert.md` for the correct INSERT pattern and gotchas.

## Enrichment pipeline

### Google Places Enrichment (All Categories)

The enrichment pipeline resolves garbled/obfuscated transaction names into real businesses.
The **default script only enriches food merchants**. For full coverage, use the 
**universal enrichment script**:

**Script:** [`styx_universal_enrichment.md`](references/styx_universal_enrichment.md) ← read this reference first

```bash
# Universal enrichment — all non-financial categories
# Created 2026-06-20. Script exists at:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
# <hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py
# references/styx_universal_enrichment.md if needed.
# Last known path (may not exist): <hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-styx/styx_universal_enrich.py

# Food-only (original script) — confirmed working
python3 <hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_places_enrich.py --all
=======
# ~/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py
# references/styx_universal_enrichment.md if needed.
# Last known path (may not exist): ~/.hermes/commons/data/ocas-styx/styx_universal_enrich.py

# Food-only (original script) — confirmed working
python3 ~/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_places_enrich.py --all
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

**Categories covered by universal script:** retail, service, entertainment, transport,
personal_care, medical, home, government, housing, travel, food/restaurant (all 10 food subcategories).

**Categories skipped (no physical location):** transfer, income, bank_fees, loan_payments,
loan_disbursements. These get `source: 'internal'`.

### Legacy LLM Enrichment Pipeline

For garbled names that Google Places can't resolve: exact match → fuzzy match → SearXNG search → LLM resolution → manual review queue. Full details: [`references/enrichment-pipeline.md`](references/enrichment-pipeline.md)

## Query API

Other skills read from Styx using these patterns:
- **Category transactions**: enriched transactions filtered by merchant category
- **Spending by merchant**: aggregated totals and visit counts
- **Unresolved transactions**: candidates needing enrichment

DB path: `{agent_root}/data/styx.db`

## Receipt Parsing Pipeline

When parsing email receipts (e.g., Rainbow Grocery):
1. **Fetch emails** via `get_gmail_messages_content_batch` — large results persisted to `/tmp/hermes-results/<uuid>.txt`
2. **Parse persisted files** — XML wrapper around JSON requires brace-depth counting to extract first complete JSON object
3. **Extract bodies** — split by `\n\nMessage ID: `, then extract between `--- BODY ---` and `---\n\n`
4. **Parse line items** — handle department headers, PLU/UPC codes, prices, weight/quantity info
5. **Write to Styx** — use the `receipt_line_items` INSERT pattern above (22 values, `id` auto-increments)

## Consumer skill contracts

### Taste
Taste reads from Styx to discover restaurants and food businesses that <operator>
has transacted with but that didn't appear in email/calendar.

Taste queries:
- `m.category IN ('restaurant', 'cafe', 'bar', 'food')` for dining
- `m.category IN ('grocery', 'supermarket', 'food_store')` for food shopping
- Transactions with `personal_finance_category = 'FOOD_AND_DRINK'` as fallback

Taste does NOT write to Styx. It writes to its own `signals.jsonl` and `items.jsonl`.

### Rally
Rally reads from Styx for spending analysis and budget tracking.

### Vesper
Vesper reads from Styx for daily/weekly spending summaries in briefings.

### Sands
Sands reads from Styx for calendar-based spending context.

## Security
- Styx DB is read-only for consumer skills (enforced by skill contract, not filesystem)
- Raw transaction data in transactions.db is never modified by Styx
- Enrichment data is additive only

## Financial Sync
- Sync script: `{skill_root}/scripts/plaid_sync.py` (incremental, daily 7 AM cron)
- History script: `{skill_root}/scripts/plaid_history.py` (full 24-month pull)
- DB: `{agent_root}/data/transactions.db` (raw, read-only)
- Cron job `a418e00ee21e`: daily 7 AM, `no_agent: true`

## Gotchas

Error handling in styx follows a strict never-modify-raw-data policy: if enrichment fails, log the error, mark the record as unresolved, and continue processing.

- **Self-update: untracked files block `git pull`** — `git stash` only stashes tracked files. New (untracked) files in the skill directory will block the merge. Move them aside before pulling, then compare/restore afterward.
- **Self-update: stash pop may conflict** — After pulling, `git stash pop` can produce merge conflicts if both the pulled changes and the stashed changes touch the same lines.
- **`query.py --health-check` does not exist** — Use inline Python to verify DB integrity instead.
- **Raw transaction data is sacred** — Styx never modifies or deletes records in `transactions.db`.
- **Name cleaning is essential** — Plaid transaction names are heavily obfuscated (e.g., `DD *DOORDASH ROYALINDI`, `ABM-350 MISSION GARAGE`). Strip prefixes before matching.
- **Redacted names can't be enriched** — Transactions with fully redacted names (`***************`) are skipped entirely.
- **Consumer skills are read-only** — Taste, Rally, Vesper, and Sands query Styx but must never write to Styx tables.
- **receipt_line_items INSERT requires 22 values** — The table has 23 columns but `id` auto-increments.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- **`google_auth_mcp` import path is profile-dependent** — When running under the `indigo` Hermes profile, `Path.home()` returns `<hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/home` instead of `/root`. Scripts that do `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.home() / '.hermes' / 'scripts'))` or `sys.path.insert(0, str(AGENT_ROOT / 'scripts'))` will fail to find `google_auth_mcp.py`. **Fix:** Hardcode `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path('<hermes-home>/scripts')))` in any script that imports `google_auth_mcp`. **Affected scripts (all fixed as of 2026-06-04):** dispatch: `triage.py`, `check_unread.py`, `gmail_search.py`, `gmail_scan.py`; taste: `email_scan.py`, `run_historical_scans.py`; scripts: `email_check.py`, `dream_journal_pipeline.py`.
- **the agent's OAuth token file may lack `client_secret`** — The token file at `<gworkspace-creds>/credentials/<third-party-or-user-email>.json` may only have `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_id` — but `google_auth_mcp.py` needs `client_secret` for token refresh and a `token` key alias. **Fix:** Add `client_secret` from the cached client secret file. Also add `token` as an alias for `access_token` and `token_uri: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'`.
- **Database and secrets path mismatch (migration artifact)** — After a profile/data migration, the active databases live at `<hermes-home>.old/data/` (`styx.db`, `transactions.db`) and secrets at `<hermes-home>.old/secrets/plaid.env`, but all scripts hardcode `<hermes-home>/data/` and `<hermes-home>/secrets/`. **Workaround:** Create symlinks before running scripts:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p <hermes-home>/data
  ln -sf <hermes-home>.old/data/styx.db <hermes-home>/data/styx.db
  ln -sf <hermes-home>.old/data/transactions.db <hermes-home>/data/transactions.db
  ln -sf <hermes-home>.old/secrets <hermes-home>/secrets
  ```
  The universal enrichment script at `<hermes-home>.old/commons/data/ocas-styx/styx_universal_enrich.py` (not in the skill's `scripts/` or `commons/data/`) must be run from that location.
- **<operator>'s token refresh adds `access_token` key** — When refreshing <operator>'s token, the Google OAuth response includes `access_token` (not `token`). The original file used `token` as the key. After refresh, both keys exist. `google_auth_mcp.py` reads `token_data.get("token")`, so ensure the `token` key is present.
=======
- **`google_auth_mcp` import path is profile-dependent** — When running under the `indigo` Hermes profile, `Path.home()` returns `~/.hermes/profiles/indigo/home` instead of `/root`. Scripts that do `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.home() / '.hermes' / 'scripts'))` or `sys.path.insert(0, str(AGENT_ROOT / 'scripts'))` will fail to find `google_auth_mcp.py`. **Fix:** Hardcode `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path('~/.hermes/scripts')))` in any script that imports `google_auth_mcp`. **Affected scripts (all fixed as of 2026-06-04):** dispatch: `triage.py`, `check_unread.py`, `gmail_search.py`, `gmail_scan.py`; taste: `email_scan.py`, `run_historical_scans.py`; scripts: `email_check.py`, `dream_journal_pipeline.py`.
- **the agent's OAuth token file may lack `client_secret`** — The token file at `<gworkspace-creds>/credentials/<agent-email>.json` may only have `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_id` — but `google_auth_mcp.py` needs `client_secret` for token refresh and a `token` key alias. **Fix:** Add `client_secret` from the cached client secret file. Also add `token` as an alias for `access_token` and `token_uri: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'`.
- **Database and secrets path mismatch (migration artifact)** — After a profile/data migration, the active databases live at `~/.hermes.old/data/` (`styx.db`, `transactions.db`) and secrets at `~/.hermes.old/secrets/plaid.env`, but all scripts hardcode `~/.hermes/data/` and `~/.hermes/secrets/`. **Workaround:** Create symlinks before running scripts:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.hermes/data
  ln -sf ~/.hermes.old/data/styx.db ~/.hermes/data/styx.db
  ln -sf ~/.hermes.old/data/transactions.db ~/.hermes/data/transactions.db
  ln -sf ~/.hermes.old/secrets ~/.hermes/secrets
  ```
  The universal enrichment script at `~/.hermes.old/commons/data/ocas-styx/styx_universal_enrich.py` (not in the skill's `scripts/` or `commons/data/`) must be run from that location.
- **<operator>'s token refresh adds `access_token` key** — When refreshing <operator>'s token, the Google OAuth response includes `access_token` (not `token`). The original file used `token` as the key. After refresh, both keys exist. `google_auth_mcp.py` reads `token_data.get("token")`, so ensure the `token` key is present.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- **styx.db may exist with no tables** — The DB file can be created empty (0 bytes) by the skill initialization script without the schema being applied. Before any receipt parsing or enrichment, verify tables exist.
- **`llm_resolve.py` does NOT work in cron/background context** — The script calls `hermes ask --no-stream` via subprocess, which returns no output when there is no interactive session.
- **styx_places_enrich.py is food-only** — The original enrichment script only covers food/restaurant categories. Use `styx_universal_enrich.py` for all categories. See `references/styx_universal_enrichment.md`.
- **SearXNG port is 8888** — The `enrich.py` script defaults to `http://localhost:8888` (not 8880). If SearXNG errors with "Connection refused", verify the container port mapping: `docker ps | grep searx`.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- **styx_universal_enrich.py created 2026-06-20** — Now exists at `<hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py`. Covers retail, service, entertainment, transport, personal_care, medical, home, government, housing, travel. Skips financial categories (transfer, income, bank_fees, loan_payments, loan_disbursements). Run: `python3 styx_universal_enrich.py --limit 0` to enrich all pending non-food merchants. Includes name cleaning (strips FSP*, SP , ABM-, etc.) and international address parsing (UK postcodes, city-only addresses).
- **Correct script path for food-only enrichment** — The food-only script lives at `<hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_places_enrich.py`, NOT at `<hermes-home>/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_places_enrich.py` (that path doesn't exist).

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- **Taste enrichment fails on LLM items in cron** — `taste_full_enrich.py` reports "Failed: N" for items requiring LLM resolution. This is because `llm_resolve.py` calls `hermes ask --no-stream` which returns no output in non-interactive/cron context. These items are not lost — they remain in the Taste items queue and will be retried on the next interactive or non-cron enrichment run. Do NOT treat these failures as pipeline errors.
- **No new transactions ≠ no work** — When Plaid sync hasn't pulled new data (check `MAX(date)` in transactions.db), `styx_universal_enrich.py` may still find 5–15 merchants to re-enrich. This is normal: the script re-queriers pending/unresolved merchants against Google Places on each run. `no_result` responses are expected for heavily obfuscated names (e.g., `DD *DOORDASH *********`, `SP THANKS ICON`).

## Cron pipeline (daily enrichment)

When invoked as a scheduled cron job, run the full pipeline in sequence:

```bash
# Step 1: Universal merchant enrichment (all categories)
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
python3 <hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py

# Step 2: Ingest enriched merchants into Taste
python3 <hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/taste_full_enrich.py

# Step 3: Deduplicate same-day Taste signals
python3 <hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/taste_signals_dedup.py
```

**IMPORTANT script paths:**
- `styx_universal_enrich.py` is at `<hermes-home>/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/` (NOT `<hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-styx/`)
- Taste scripts are at `<hermes-home>/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/`
=======
python3 ~/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py

# Step 2: Ingest enriched merchants into Taste
python3 ~/.hermes/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/taste_full_enrich.py

# Step 3: Deduplicate same-day Taste signals
python3 ~/.hermes/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/taste_signals_dedup.py
```

**IMPORTANT script paths:**
- `styx_universal_enrich.py` is at `~/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/` (NOT `~/.hermes/commons/data/ocas-styx/`)
- Taste scripts are at `~/.hermes/commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/`
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

**Expected cron behaviors:**
- If no new transactions since last sync, `styx_universal_enrich.py` may still find a small number (5–15) of merchants to re-enrich. These are already-enriched merchants being re-queried against Google Places. `no_result` is expected for garbled names that Google can't match — the existing enrichment from prior runs (searxng, plaid_merchant_name, internal) is preserved.
- `taste_full_enrich.py` may report "Failed: N" for items that need LLM resolution. This is a known cron limitation (`llm_resolve.py` calls `hermes ask` which returns no output without an interactive session). Items will be retried on the next non-cron enrichment run.

**Report format:** After cron run, report: merchants enriched by category, new Taste items created, signals deduped, and any errors. See `references/cron-gotchas.md` for expected cron behaviors that are NOT errors.

## Post-enrichment verification

After every enrichment run, verify the results before marking the run as complete:
1. Spot-check 5–10 enriched `transaction_merchants` records at random.
2. Confirm the `enrichment_runs` table row for this run shows status `completed`.
3. Verify `review_queue.jsonl` has been updated with any new low-confidence matches.
