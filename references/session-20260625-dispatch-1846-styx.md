# Styx Enrichment Status — 2026-06-25

## Universal Enrichment Run (18:46 UTC)
- Script: `python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py --limit 0`
- **31 merchants enriched** (new: Taco Los Altos, Philz Coffee, lululemon SF, Extreme Pizza, Serrano's Pizza, Etsy shops, Heritage Thai Spa, Berkeley Bowl, Lavender Bread & Cafe, etc.)
- **8 failed** (non-placeable): Kalshi, Lugg Hold, Querytracker, Citi Autopay, Harbor View HOA, Livykate Clothing, Alves Cleaning, SP LIVYKATE
- **Remaining unenriched non-financial: 69** (all expected non-placeable)

## Convergence State
As of 2026-06-25, Google Places enrichment is **effectively complete** for physical merchants. The ~69 remaining unenriched merchants are all non-placeable:
- Financial: loan_payments, income, transfer_out, transfer_in, bank_fees, loan_disbursements
- Non-placeable businesses: Kalshi (prediction market), Lugg Hold (luggage storage), Querytracker (survey platform), etc.

**Recommendation:** Continue running `--limit 0` periodically (weekly) to catch new transactions from Plaid sync, but don't expect significant new enrichment. The value of running it now is catching new merchants added by the daily Plaid sync.

## DB State
- transactions.db: 1,189 transactions (last: 2026-06-24)
- styx.db: 1,193 transaction_merchants links, 493 merchants
